Question 1: Fitness Level Checker

The `getFitnessLevel(int steps)` method takes the number of steps a user walked in a day and returns their fitness level based on the following criteria:

- **Excellent**: steps ≥ 10,000
- **Good**: steps ≥ 7,000 and < 10,000
- **Average**: steps ≥ 4,000 and < 7,000
- **Poor**: steps < 4,000

The user is prompted to enter their step count, and the program prints their fitness level.
